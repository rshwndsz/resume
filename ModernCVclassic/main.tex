  \opening{Dear Internship Coordinator,}
  \enclosure[Attached]{curriculum vit\ae{}}
  \makelettertitle

  I am writing to express my interest in the Robotics Internship program that opened on August 19, 2019. 
  I am extremely interested in computer vision and its applications in human vision, early diagnosis of diseases and swarm robotics. 
  DeepMind was the team that brought me into the field of AI with AlphaGo and its historic win. 
  I would be delighted to be an intern with your organization.

  I am an undergraduate at the National Institute of Technology, Karnataka, India pursuing a bachelor's degree in Electronics \& Communication
  engineering, and will receive my degree in 3 semesters. 
  In my 2 years at my college, I've completed relevant coursework on signal processing, digital system design and embedded system design. 
  The courses I have taken provide me the fundamentals of many domains including microcontrollers, computer architecture, image processing, linear algebra, probability.

  I spent the last summer studying computer vision and deep learning, specifically its applications in biomedical image segmentation for the diagnosis of kidney cancer. I learnt the fundamentals of machine learning, deep learning, and how to build a deep learning solution. 
  I also learnt the value of time management, research and organisation. 
  I used all that I learnt during the summer and applied it to personal projects involving Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Blockchain. 
  I spent the summer of 2018 working as a Python developer for a local firm which helped me grow my skills in team collaboration and verbal communication.

  I believe that my projects, skills, experiences, and interests have prepared me to be a strong intern for your program. 
  I look forward to hearing from you.\\
  Thank you for your time and consideration.

  Sincerely,\\
  Russel Shawn Dsouza
